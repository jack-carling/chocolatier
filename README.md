# Chocolatier

This project is inspired by Chocolate Academy's lead chef Russ Thayer's paper on ganache balancing.

Ganache is a complex mixture of solids and liquids, being both a suspension and an emulsion at the same time. A good balance of ingredients will ensure that we have the strongest emulsions and the correct quantities of liquids and solids, resulting in success across a wide range of criteria, such as taste, texture, and sweetness.

If we look beyond just the weight of each ingredient, and instead examine each ingredient as a percentage, and how the percentage of each ingredient is related to the other ingredients, and to the total recipe, we can start to customize our recipes based on flavor, texture, sweetness, and shelf life.

Each ingredient in our ganache directly interacts with the others, and understanding how they do so, by looking at the relationship between their ratios, well....

Thatâ€™s Balancing!

## About

This is a calculator to balance ganache (chocolate making). Changing values, adding and removing ingredients will trigger calculations and render the graph.
